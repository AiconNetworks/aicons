# 🧠 BayesBrain: A Bayesian Cognitive Framework for Agent Design

BayesBrain is a biologically inspired, probabilistic agent framework unifying Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Bayesian Brain hypothesis. It allows agents to **perceive**, **reason**, and **act** under uncertainty — using **LLMs as experiential priors**, and **Bayesian inference** for state estimation and decision-making.

> This is the foundation for the upcoming **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** — a modular framework for building intelligent agents that think, plan, and adapt like brains.

---

## 🧭 Core Concepts

BayesBrain is built on the following principles:

- **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis**: The brain is a probabilistic machine. It updates beliefs using Bayes’ rule, minimizes prediction error, and models the world hierarchically.
- **LLMs as Prior Memory**: Language models like GPT act as compressed experiential memory. They help agents form structured priors based on learned patterns.
- **Sensor-Driven Perception**: The agent uses inputs (APIs, streams, user text) as _sensor data_ to infer the hidden state of the world.
- **Utility-Based Planning**: Agents select actions that maximize expected utility, balancing uncertain outcomes and organizational constraints.
- **Hierarchical Reasoning**: Both priors and decisions are modeled hierarchically, allowing agents to reason abstractly while grounding their actions in perception.

## 📦 What’s Inside

### 🧠 `core/`

The reasoning engine:

- `perception.py`: Bayesian state inference (`posterior = prior × likelihood`)
- `memory.py`: LLM-based prior generation & refinement
- `planning.py`: Expected utility calculation
- `action_space.py`: Defines feasible and constrained actions
- `sensors.py`: Sensor interface, data normalization, uncertainty modeling

### 🤖 `examples/`

Working demos and use cases:

- `ad_campaign.py`: Bayesian ad budget optimization using Meta API data
- `trip_planner.py`: Weather-informed movement planning

### 📚 `theory/`

Documentation of key ideas and research foundations:

- Predictive coding
- Active inference
- LLMs as probabilistic memory
- Utility functions in decision theory

## 🔍 Quickstart

> Want to test-drive the concept?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bayesbrain.git
```

````

You’ll see:

- Belief updates based on incoming "sensor" data (e.g. from an ad API)
- Posterior sampling (via HMC or MC methods)
- Expected utility computed across actions
- The best action selected based on updated beliefs

## 🚧 Roadmap

We’re building toward the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** — a complete toolkit for developers and researchers to build intelligent, adaptive agents.

### ✅ Phase 1: Launch Research Repo (✔ this is it)

- Share theory + early examples
- Validate architecture in real-world use cases

### 🔜 Phase 2: Demos + Modularization

- More examples (marketing, robotics, finance)
- Modular ADK API (`Agent()`, `Sensor()`, etc.)

### 🔜 Phase 3: ADK Beta Launch

- CLI tools for agent creation
- Config-based agents
- Plugin system for memory, perception, and planners
