    Simulate fetching environmental data context from a large language model (LLM).
    In a real implementation, this function would make an API call to an LLM (like GPT)
    and parse its output.

    The expected output is a dictionary containing key-value pairs corresponding to state factors.
    For example:
        {
            "rain": 12.0,
            "temperature": 25.0,
            "traffic": "Heavy",
            "weather": "Stormy"
        }
    
    Optionally, the function can also include metadata about confidence or prior weights.
